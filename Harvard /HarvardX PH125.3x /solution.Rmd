Exercise 1. Probability of cyan - generalized
In the edX exercises for this section, we calculated some probabilities by hand. Now we'll calculate those probabilities using R.

One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.

What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?


Define a variable p as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box.
Print the value of p.





```{r}
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

```
Assign a variable `p` as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box


```{r}
p <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)


```
 Print the variable `p` to the console
 
```{r}
p
```
